"""Verified read-only recipes over the pipeline tables.

Thin, curated wrappers around ``free_query`` for questions that need a SQL join rather
than path arithmetic. The contract for anything added here:

1. **Read-only.** Writes belong to the table classes, ``services/inspection.py`` or
   ``services/database/sync.py`` -- never here.
2. **Names and paths in, names and paths out.** Never expose or require a row id; a
   caller holding a FITS file should not have to look one up.
3. **Verified against production data before landing**, and documented in
   ``.claude/memory/api-recipes.md`` -- that file is the index for these.
4. **No new abstractions.** If a question needs state or a class, it belongs in a real
   module; if it is answerable from PathHandler/NameHandler or RawFrameQuery, use those
   instead of re-asking the database.
