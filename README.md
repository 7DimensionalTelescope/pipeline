## Overview
gppy is a comprehensive pipeline designed for processing optical and near-infrared (NIR) astronomical images from IMSNG/GECKO and 7DT facilities. The package implements a multi-threaded approach utilizing GPU and CPU multiprocessing to efficiently handle various stages of astronomical data processing, including:

- Data reduction
- Astrometric calibration
- Photometric calibration
- Image stacking
- Image subtraction
- Automated transient detection

## Installation
We recommend using `conda` for installation:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This command will create a new environment named `pipeline` with all required packages listed in `environment.yml`. Activate this environment by running `conda activate pipeline`. Additionally, you will need to install external packages from [astromatic.net](https://www.astromatic.net/software/): `MissFITs`, `SCAMP`, `SWarp`, `SExtractor`, etc.

## History and Development
Development of gpPy began in 2018 by Gregory Peak. The first stable release was published on September 1, 2023. The package underwent significant renovation in February 2025 to integrate with the 7DT pipeline system.
